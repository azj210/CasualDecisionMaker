# DailyDashboard
A dashboard webapp that leverages various datasets to help users check on weather, days to an important event, and daily recommendations in categories like songs, cocktails, and food. 

Users can create an account with an email address. Password recovery via email confirmation, password reset, and account deletion features are available.

The main dashboard feature is customizable and so are the preferences for the aforementioned categories. The user's dashboard display will change based on various factors like time of the day and weather. The daily category recommendations are also updated once a day or when the user changes a particular preference/daily category.
